<h4>Here is a short biography of me</h4>
<p>
My name is Edwin Philip Damilola and I'm a budding software engineer.  I have a National Diploma in computer science from the Kogi State Polytechnic Lokoja. I am also currently taking a one-year diploma course in software engineering from <a href="altschoolafrica.com">AltSchool Africa.</a><br />

Reading is one of my favorite things to do. I enjoy reading fiction, nonfiction, and self-help books. I also enjoy coding as it helps one build critical thinking and problem-solving skills. <br />
You can follow me on my Twitter page <a href="twitter.com/DamilolaEdwin">@DamilolaEdwin</a> where I tweet about software engineering and self-development.

<h4>Reason Why I'm in Altschool Africa</h4>
<p>
I've always wanted to become a software engineer since my secondary school days. I tried some self-learning platforms (Codecademy) but couldn't keep up because most learning platforms lack the sense of community AltSchool Africa gives. The <b>learning circle</b> (which is a study group for students taking similar courses ) helps in making the learning process more fun and encourages collaboration between students. <br />
Additionally,  AltSchool Africa's learning content is tailored to African audiences which makes learning relatable and enjoyable.

<h4 id="goal">My Goal for Altschool Africa</h4>
<p>
My main goal for AltSchool Africa is to graduate as a <b>world-class software engineer.</b> I am going to be among the best students graduating from my set. I believe that the school is helping us hone the much-needed skills to compete on the world stage with other engineers from other continents.
